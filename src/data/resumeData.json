The project is developed in Python. We use Autoencoder techniques (Denoising and Sliced-Wasserstein) to represent artworks images (obtaining a low-dimension representation) . Developed with Keras and Tensorflow. Also, we add an influence graph to connect authors. This graph was extracted from DBpedia Ontology and modeled using Networkx library. To compare vectors, we analyze different metrics, provided by Sklearn and Scipy. Nowadays, we have an API that is developed with Flask and Flask-Restplus and is deployed in Google App Engine"

The project is developed in Python. To model the items, we use word embedding techniques (Word2Vect and GLoVe). Developed with GenSim library. To link books and movies, we decided to generate an influence graph that connect authors. This graph was extracted from DBpedia Ontology and modeled using Networkx library. To compare vectors, we analyze different metrics, provided by Sklearn. Also, to store and manage the data, we use Pandas and MySql."
